# Capstone_Project
Machine Learning Capstone Project
This project uses machine learning to predict the categorization of a motorcycle based on the weight and engine displacement input by the user

User Guide:
1.	Download and install Python 3.12
2.	Install Jupyter Notebook using the following command in command prompt:
    a.	py -m pip install notebook
3.  Install ‘matplotlib’ using the following command in command prompt:
    a.	py -m pip install matplotlib
6.	Install ‘scikit-learn’ using the following command in command prompt:
    a.	py -m pip install scikit-learn
7.	Install ‘pandas’ using the following command in command prompt:
    a.	py -m pip install pandas
8.	Run Jupyter Notebook using the following command in command prompt:
    a.	py -m jupyter notebook
    NOTE: If Jupyter Notebook does not automatically open in a browser, copy and paste the link listed under the section labeled “This page should redirect you to a      Jupyter application” into a browser
9.	Navigate to where the program was downloaded to in the Jupyter interface
10.	Open “Capstone Jupyter.ipynb”
11.	Select the “Run” tab at the top of the notebook, and select “Run all cells”
12.	Enter the information into the prompts asking for the weight (in kg) and engine displacement (in cc) of the motorcycle
